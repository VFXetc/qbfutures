- Attach args and kwargs to futures?
- Attach job and work to futures, and update them on every poll?

- Job to print out environment of every machine on the farm

- Event server
    - qbfutures.event.send(event) sends arbitrary data back to the handler

- Whenever there is an update, update future.job and future.work.
    - Only promise to update them in place, and not to remove stale things OR
      to update subobjects (e.g. `env`) in place.

- .core.Executor.submit_range('1-10', func, *args, **kwargs)
    - func recieves the frame as the first argument

- be able to trigger emails after the fact?
    this could be a part of our custom qube prototype
        
- match both the concurrent.futures API and the multiprocessing one
    - unordered_imap, etc.
