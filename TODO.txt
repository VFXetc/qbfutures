    - installing the custom types
    - weakrefs
    - recursion
    - string entrypoints instead of callables

- Job to print out environment of every machine on the farm

- Event server
    - qbfutures.event.send(event) sends arbitrary data back to the handler

- Whenever there is an update, update future.job and future.work.
    - Only promise to update them in place, and not to remove stale things OR
      to update subobjects (e.g. `env`) in place.

- `from maya import cmds` somewhere is failing
    - Install a different exception handler when on the farm that increases the
      exception detail in the Maya console so that we get a full traceback.

- Mark's stuff is causing memory map dumps when it is done.
    - After the job ran
    - On both Fedora 11 and 14

- Remove things that qube can't pickle from the package to avoid the error:
    "unrecognized object encountered during conversion."
    - just replace them with 'PICKLED:%r'

- .core.Executor.submit_range('1-10', func, *args, **kwargs)
    - func recieves the frame as the first argument

- be able to trigger emails after the fact?
    this could be a part of our custom qube prototype
        
- match both the concurrent.futures API and the multiprocessing one
    - unordered_imap, etc.

- Maya is segfaulting after running some things
    see 27180

- Maya environment not being setup properly
    python-bin[18954]: segfault at 0 ip 00007fb750f96724 sp 00007fff2a387b90 error 4 in libCommandEngine.so[7fb750f36000+ed000]
