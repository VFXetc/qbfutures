- Docs
    - installing the custom types

- Event server
    - qbfutures.event.send(event) sends arbitrary data back to the handler

- Whenever there is an update, update future.job and future.work.
    - Only promise to update them in place, and not to remove stale things OR
      to update subobjects (e.g. `env`) in place.

- `from maya import cmds` somewhere is failing

- Mark's stuff is causing core dumps after it is done
- Remove things that qube can't pickle from the package to avoid the error:
    "unrecognized object encountered during conversion."
    - just replace them with 'PICKLED:%r'

- .core.Executor.submit_range('1-10', func, *args, **kwargs)
    - func recieves the frame as the first argument

- be able to trigger emails after the fact?
    this could be a part of our custom qube prototype
        
- match both the concurrent.futures API and the multiprocessing one
    - unordered_imap, etc.
