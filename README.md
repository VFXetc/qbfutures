qbfutures
=========

This Python package is a implementation of a (`concurrent.futures.Executor`)[http://docs.python.org/dev/library/concurrent.futures.html] for (PipelineFX's Qube)[http://pipelinefx.com/]. The API is compatible with the standard `Executor` and provides extensions for working with Qube.

Good luck, (read the docs)[http://qbfutures.readthedocs.org/], and happy queueing!
